Description: Extension for Nautilus to hide files without renaming them
 Nautilus Hide is a simple Python extension for the Nautilus file manager that
 adds options to the right-click menu to hide or unhide files.
 .
 The extension hides the files without renaming them (i.e. without prefixing a
 dot ('.') or suffixing a tilde ('~')).
 It does that by adding their names to the folder's '.hidden' file, which
 Nautilus reads to hide the listed files the next time you open or refresh the
 folder.
